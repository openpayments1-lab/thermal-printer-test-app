Key Findings

No PrinterInstance or SDK integration calls detected

The APK does not reference any PrinterInstance, openConnection(), printText(), or printImage() methods from the printersdkv5.7.2.jar library.

This means your current build isnâ€™t actually communicating with the printer SDK â€” it either:

wasnâ€™t linked at compile time, or

is being stripped by ProGuard / R8 during the build process.

Missing Bluetooth / USB print connection logic

The compiled app doesnâ€™t contain Bluetooth connect, USB connect, or handler logic for printing success/failure events.

The sample logic from the SDK (which should exist) looks like this:

PrinterInstance mPrinter = PrinterInstance.getPrinterInstance(device, handler);
mPrinter.openConnection();
mPrinter.printText("Hello World\n");
mPrinter.closeConnection();


None of these appear in your APK.

Manifest permissions are incomplete

The manifest extracted from your APK does not declare modern Bluetooth permissions for Android 12+ (BLUETOOTH_CONNECT, BLUETOOTH_SCAN).

Without these, your app cannot discover or connect to the printer on recent Android versions.

No JNI or .so files

The app package doesnâ€™t include the required libserial_port.so in /jniLibs/armeabi/.

If your printer connects via USB or serial, the connection will silently fail.

ðŸ§© Why Itâ€™s Not Printing

Your APK doesnâ€™t actually invoke or package the print SDK at runtime â€” so while it may contain UI elements related to printing, the print command never reaches the printer hardware layer.

âœ… Fix Recommendations

Verify SDK Integration

In Android Studio, confirm that your app build.gradle includes:

implementation files('libs/printersdkv5.7.2.jar')


Rebuild your app and ensure the JAR isnâ€™t excluded by ProGuard:

-keep class com.printer.sdk.** { *; }


Add Required Permissions

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>


Include Native Library (if needed)

Copy libserial_port.so from the SDK demo (PrintDemo/libs/armeabi/) into your projectâ€™s jniLibs/armeabi/ folder.

Implement a Connection Test

Use the same structure as the SDK sample:

PrinterInstance mPrinter = PrinterInstance.getPrinterInstance(device, handler);
if (mPrinter.openConnection()) {
    mPrinter.printText("Test Print\n");
    mPrinter.closeConnection();
}


Compare with Demo (PrintDemozx.apk)

Install PrintDemozx.apk on your device.
If it prints correctly, your device and printer hardware are fine â€” the issue lies entirely in your app-debug.apk integration.
