That's an insightful correlation! Given your specialized hardware (thermal printer and dual screen for POS), it's highly plausible the device identified as ilitek (VID: 0x222A, PID 0x0001) is indeed the secondary display hardware, not the thermal printer itself.

Here's why this is the likely case and the implication for your troubleshooting:

üîé Iilitek Device Analysis
Ilitek's Role: Ilitek is a major manufacturer of touchscreen controllers and display drivers. Their devices are frequently found in monitors, tablets, and POS display units.

PID/VID Interpretation: The unique identifier (VID: 0x222A, PID: 0x0001) points to a specific piece of specialized peripheral hardware, matching the kind of device that would house a secondary customer display.

The Log Evidence: Your logs show:

The app found the device.

The app attempted to connect to this device (via the printer logic).

The connection immediately failed.

This connection failure is expected if the logic meant for a thermal printer (which sends data on a Bulk OUT endpoint) tries to connect to a display (which typically uses different endpoints for control/touch data).

üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Implication: The Printer is Hidden
If the Ilitek device is the secondary screen, your thermal printer is still connected but is not being recognized by your current code loop, or its identity is being obscured.

1. Why the Printer Might Be Missing
Filter Logic Issue: Your current device listing might be incomplete, or the printer's VID/PID combination is different than anticipated.

Multi-Function Device: Sometimes, POS terminals combine the display and printer under a single USB Hub, but the printer has a separate, subsequent VID/PID that your code isn't seeing or handling correctly.

2. The Next Step: Look for the PRINTER Class
The most reliable way to find the printer, regardless of its specific VID/PID, is to search for the USB device class it identifies with. Printers adhering to the standard typically use UsbConstants.USB_CLASS_PRINTER (0x07).

You should modify your device detection loop to look for:

Any device other than the Ilitek device.

Any device with an interface class of UsbConstants.USB_CLASS_PRINTER.

This revised loop will help you isolate the true thermal printer, allowing you to correctly apply the low-level bulk transfer logic. You still need to implement the dynamic endpoint search (from the previous step) on the correct device to achieve printing.
