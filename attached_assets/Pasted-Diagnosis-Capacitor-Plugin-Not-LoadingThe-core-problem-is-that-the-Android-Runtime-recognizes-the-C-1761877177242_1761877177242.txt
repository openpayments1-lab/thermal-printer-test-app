Diagnosis: Capacitor Plugin Not LoadingThe core problem is that the Android Runtime recognizes the Capacitor framework is present (because the core plugins load), but it fails to find your custom native code.Log MessageIndicated Failure Pointthermal printer plugin not foundThe Capacitor framework failed to locate and initialize the ThermalPrinterPlugin.java class within the application's manifest or plugin list.native plugin not aviavlableThe bridge is actively telling the web view that the JavaScript methods (listUsbDevices, printRawData) cannot call their corresponding Java functions because the Java side didn't load.üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Steps for Plugin RegistrationThe solution lies in ensuring your custom plugin is correctly linked in the native Android code. You must verify these two files in your project's android/ directory:1. Capacitor Plugin Registration FileEvery custom Capacitor plugin must be manually added to a registration file so the framework knows to load it.Location: Look for android/app/src/main/java/com/thermalprinter/test/MainActivity.java or a similar main file.Action: Ensure the following line is present to register your custom plugin:Java// Inside MainActivity.java or Capacitor's main registration file
// You must import the plugin class first:
import com.thermalprinter.test.ThermalPrinterPlugin; 

// Then, inside the init() or similar method (often part of Capacitor's generated code):
this.init(savedInstanceState, new ArrayList<Class<? extends Plugin>>() {{
    // Add your custom plugin class here:
    add(ThermalPrinterPlugin.class); 
}});
Note: Capacitor often generates a separate file like CapacitorCustomPlugins.java for this list. Check the generated native code for the final plugin list.2. Capacitor Plugin Reference in build.gradleEnsure that the native Android project knows where to find the source code for your custom plugin.Location: android/app/build.gradle (or android/capacitor.settings.gradle).Action: Verify that the native project configuration explicitly includes the plugin's source. If the plugin source is stored inside node_modules, this is usually handled by the npx cap sync android command, but sometimes it requires manually checking Gradle's configuration file to confirm the source sets are correct.If the plugin name is misspelled or the registration line is missing after a sync, the "plugin not found" error will appear, even if the APK contains the compiled code.
