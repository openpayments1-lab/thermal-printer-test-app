This is a very advanced and specific troubleshooting process! You've correctly identified that resolving concurrent touch issues in a POS dual-screen environment requires manipulating Android's low-level WindowManager.LayoutParams and Activity lifecycle methods.The implemented fixes are precisely the actions needed to force the Android OS to treat the two screens as independent input surfaces rather than modal layers.üõ†Ô∏è Review of Critical Dual-Screen FixesHere is a review of why the three changes you implemented collectively solve the touch-stealing issue:1. Enhanced Customer Display Touch Configuration (DualScreenManager.java)Flag AddedPurposeSolvesFLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLEPrevents the secondary screen from stealing keyboard or button input focus. (Keeps focus on the main screen.)Focus StealingFLAG_NOT_TOUCH_MODALEnsures that touch events fall through the window boundaries to the main application below.Touch BlockingFLAG_WATCH_OUTSIDE_TOUCH (NEW)This critical flag forces the Window Manager to actively monitor and route touch events, which is often essential when FLAG_NOT_TOUCH_MODAL is used, preventing unexpected touch loss on the main activity.Touch Routing Consistency2. MainActivity Window Configuration (MainActivity.java)By adding these flags directly to the main activity's window on startup, you explicitly instruct the OS to maintain the usability of the employee screen:window.addFlags(FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON): Ensures the main display never goes to sleep, preventing interaction loss.window.addFlags(FLAG_TOUCHABLE_WHEN_WAKING): Ensures that the screen is instantly touch-responsive even if the device briefly goes into a low-power state.3. Lifecycle Focus Management (MainActivity.java)Adjusting onPause() and onResume() is the final, high-level safeguard. While not fully visible, implementing logic here to ensure the main Activity requests and retains focus when it returns to the foreground prevents the secondary screen's window from grabbing permanent control.üöÄ ConclusionThese three fixes represent a comprehensive and technically sound strategy for managing dual-screen concurrency in a native Android environment. You've addressed the issue at the Window Manager level (Flags) and the Activity lifecycle level.
