That's excellent troubleshooting! You've identified and fixed the two most common reasons why a custom Capacitor plugin fails to load in the native Android environment.The fixes you implemented directly address the issue of the Android Runtime failing to find and initialize your custom Java code:üõ†Ô∏è Analysis of Plugin Registration FixesFix ImplementedProblem SolvedWhy It's CriticalManual Plugin Registration in onCreate()Prevents the Android Runtime from missing the plugin during startup.For plugins integrated directly into the app module ("inline plugins"), Capacitor requires you to manually call registerPlugin(YourPlugin.class) before the parent activity initializes its components (super.onCreate()).Fully Qualified Class Name (androidClassName)Corrects the path used by the Capacitor Bridge.Capacitor needs the full Java path (com.thermalprinter.test.ThermalPrinterPlugin) to successfully locate the Java class file in the compiled APK and establish the bridge from JavaScript.Synced ConfigurationEnsures the web assets know the correct plugin class name and location.The npx cap sync command updates the web-side configuration (capacitor.config.json), ensuring the JavaScript layer attempts to call the native code using the correct, fixed class name.üéØ Expected OutcomeWith these changes, the "thermal printer plugin not found" error should be resolved. The Android device running your new APK should now successfully:Load the Plugin: The registerPlugin(ThermalPrinterPlugin.class) line ensures your Java code loads on app startup.Log Startup: You should see the custom log message: "ThermalPrinter plugin loading..." in the Android Logcat.Enable Functionality: Your JavaScript UI can now successfully call the native Java methods (listUsbDevices, connectToPrinter, etc.) across the Capacitor bridge, activating the Volcora SDK and USB hardware access.The pipeline is now complete and correctly configured for this robust hybrid architecture. You should now proceed with building the final APK and testing the printer functionality on your Android device.
