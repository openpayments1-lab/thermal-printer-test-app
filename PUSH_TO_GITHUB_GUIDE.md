## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed" when pushing
- Make sure you're using a **Personal Access Token** (not your password)
- Token needs `repo` and `workflow` permissions
- Create a new token if needed

### "No remote configured"
- Make sure you added the GitHub repository URL in Git pane settings
- URL should end with `.git`

### GitHub Actions build failed
- Click on the failed workflow
- Read the error messages
- Most common: Node/Java version issues (already configured correctly)

### Can't see Git pane in Replit
- Click Tools in left sidebar
- Find "Git" in the list
- Click to open it

### APK won't install on phone
- Android version must be 5.0 or higher
- Enable "Install from unknown sources" in Settings
- Make sure you extracted the ZIP file first
